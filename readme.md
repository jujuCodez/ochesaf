## LECTURE 5  
### Overview of Hazards

---

### Chemical and Dust Hazards

- Are present when a worker is exposed to any chemical preparation in the workplace in any form (solid, liquid, or gas). Some are safer than others, but to some workers who are more sensitive to chemicals, even common solutions can cause illness, skin irritation, or breathing problems.

- **Beware of:**
  - Liquids like cleaning products, paints, acids, solvents – **ESPECIALLY** if chemicals are in an unlabeled container!
  - Vapors and fumes that come from welding or exposure to solvents
  - Gases like acetylene, propane, carbon monoxide, and helium
  - Flammable materials like gasoline, solvents, and explosive chemicals
  - Pesticides

---

### Biological Hazards

- Associated with working with animals, people, or infectious plant materials. Work in schools, day care facilities, colleges and universities, hospitals, laboratories, emergency response, nursing homes, outdoor occupations, etc., may expose you to biological hazards.

- **Types of things you may be exposed to include:**
  - Blood and other body fluids
  - Fungi/mold
  - Bacteria and viruses
  - Plants
  - Insect bites
  - Animal and bird droppings

---

### Ergonomic Hazards

- Occur when the type of work, body positions, and working conditions put strain on your body. They are the hardest to spot since you don’t always immediately notice the strain on your body or the harm that these hazards pose. Short-term exposure may result in “sore muscles” the next day or in the days following exposure, but long-term exposure can result in serious long-term illnesses.

- **Ergonomic Hazards include:**
  - Improperly adjusted workstations and chairs
  - Frequent lifting
  - Poor posture
  - Awkward movements, especially if they are repetitive
  - Repeating the same movements over and over
  - Having to use too much force, especially if you have to do it frequently
  - Vibration

---

### Work Organization Hazards

- Hazards or stressors that cause stress (short-term effects) and strain (long-term effects). These are the hazards associated with workplace issues such as workload, lack of control and/or respect, etc.

- **Examples of work organization hazards include:**
  - Workload demands
  - Workplace violence
  - Intensity and/or pace
  - Respect (or lack of)
  - Flexibility
  - Control or say about things
  - Social support/relations
  - Sexual harassment

---

### Safety Hazards

- These are the most common and will be present in most workplaces at one time or another. They include unsafe conditions that can cause injury, illness, and death.

- **Safety Hazards include:**
  - Spills on floors or tripping hazards, such as blocked aisles or cords running across the floor
  - Working from heights, including ladders, scaffolds, roofs, or any raised work area
  - Unguarded machinery and moving machinery parts; guards removed or moving parts that a worker can accidentally touch
  - Electrical hazards like frayed cords, missing ground pins, improper wiring
  - Confined spaces
  - Machinery-related hazards (lockout/tagout, boiler safety, forklifts, etc.)

---

### Physical Hazards

- Are factors within the environment that can harm the body without necessarily touching it.

- **Physical Hazards include:**
  - Radiation: including ionizing, non-ionizing (EMF’s, microwaves, radiowaves, etc.)
  - High exposure to sunlight/ultraviolet rays
  - Temperature extremes – hot and cold
  - Constant loud noise

---

- “Work organization” is at the center of the chart and all the other hazard categories surround it.

- This is because for many workplace health and safety issues the way our jobs are designed can be a contributing factor to other hazards we might experience.

---

### Hierarchy of Controls

- The goal of any solution is to provide the maximum amount of protection by eliminating or minimizing the exposure or hazard.

- These are referred to as the hierarchy of controls, how you prevent or control a hazard:

- **Elimination/Substitution:** The main goal for any fix to a hazard or exposure is to eliminate it altogether or substitute a product or method of doing the work to a less hazardous alternative (e.g., green cleaning products).

---

### CONTROLS: Engineering

- **Control at the source**
  - Limits the hazard but doesn’t entirely remove it.

- **Examples:** Mechanical Guards; Wet Methods for Dust; Enclosures/Isolation; Dilution Ventilation

- The basic concept behind engineering controls is that, to the extent feasible, the work environment and the job itself should be designed to eliminate hazards or reduce exposure to hazards. While this approach is called engineering controls, it does not necessarily mean that an engineer is required to design the control.

- Engineering controls are the "first line of defense" against injury/illness, because they have the potential to completely eliminate a hazard and do not rely on human behavior to be effective.

- For instance, rather than require employees to wear respiratory protection which must be monitored, inspected, trained, managed, it's much more effective to install a ventilation system that does not require any of those management activities or, better yet, find an alternative substitute that is less hazardous.

---

### CONTROLS: Administrative

- **Aimed at Reducing Employee Exposure to Hazards but Not Removing Them!**

- **Changes in work procedures such as:**
  - Written safety policies/rules
  - Schedule changes, such as:
    - Lengthened or Additional Rest Breaks
    - Job Rotation
    - Adjusting the Work Pace

- Training with the goal of reducing the duration, frequency, and severity of exposure to hazards

- Administrative controls or work practice controls are changes in work procedures such as written safety policies, rules, supervision, schedules, and training with the goal of reducing the duration, frequency, and severity of exposure to hazardous chemicals or situations.

- As with work practice controls, administrative controls normally are used in conjunction with other controls that more directly prevent or control exposure to hazards.

---

### CONTROLS: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

- **Control of LAST RESORT!**
  - Special Clothing
  - Eye Protection
  - Hearing Protection
  - Respiratory Protection

- **CONTROL IS AT THE WORKER!**

- Personal protective equipment (PPE): A method that prevents a worker from being exposed to the hazard by something the worker wears. PPE is considered the method of last resort because PPE does nothing to reduce or eliminate the hazard. If the PPE fails, immediate exposure is the result.

---

### Elements of an Effective Safety and Health Program

- **Management Commitment and Employee Involvement**
- **Worksite Analysis**
- **Hazard Prevention and Control**
- **Safety and Health Training**

---

### Management Commitment and Employee Involvement

- Top management involvement should be visible and have authority and resources to implement the program.

- Employee involvement in the program and in decisions that affect their safety and health should be encouraged.

- Top management involvement in implementing the program so that all employees understand that it is a serious commitment.

  - This commitment provides the motivating force and resources for organizing and controlling activities within an organization and ability to get things done.
  - Requires that responsible parties have the necessary authority and equipment, so that assigned responsibilities can be met.

- Encourage employee involvement in the program and in decisions that affect their safety and health.

  - Employee involvement provides the means through which workers develop and express their own commitment to safety and health protection. **OWNERSHIP!**
  - Make full use of everyone’s insight and energy.
  - Requires an atmosphere that employees feel encouraged to participate and report health and safety concerns.

---

### Worksite Analysis

- Identify all existing hazards and conditions that might create new hazards.

- An efficient program includes actively analyzing the work and the worksite to anticipate and prevent harmful occurrences.

- Identification of all hazards by conducting baseline worksite surveys for safety and health and periodic comprehensive update surveys.

- Also included would be an analysis of planned and new facilities, processes, materials, and equipment; and another of routine job hazards.

- Regular site safety and health inspections, so that new or previously missed hazards and failures in hazard controls are identified.

---

### Hazard Prevention and Control

- Triggered by a determination that a hazard or potential hazard exists.

  - Where feasible, prevent hazards by effective design of job or job site.
  - Where elimination is not feasible, control hazards to prevent unsafe and unhealthful exposure.
  - Elimination or control must be accomplished in a timely manner.

---

### Safety and Health Training

- Address the safety and health responsibilities of all personnel.

- Ensure that all employees understand the hazards to which they may be exposed and how to prevent harm to themselves and others from exposure to these hazards.

- Ensure that managers understand their safety and health responsibilities.

- Training is a critical part of a health and safety program.

- Training is most effective when incorporated into other training about performance requirements and job practices.

- Complexity depends on size and complexity of the worksite and nature of hazards.
